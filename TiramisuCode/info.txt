The files that work and are needed are:
fixNaProblem - do before anything else

with gdal (env name == tira)
original_training_data
clean_datatiles - can be removed and inserted into original_training_data
FCN_augment - no issues here

tiramisu_tf2: the model on its own

Train_FCN_datagen - fine but could do with clearing some of the comments. 

runTiramisu and testing_tiles can be redone together.
